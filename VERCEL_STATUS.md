# Vercel Deployment Status

## Current Issue: Tender Saving Not Working

### Problem Identified:
The `/api/sync` route was using Node.js file system operations which don't work on Vercel's serverless environment.

### Solution Applied:
- Replaced file system storage with memory storage
- Updated API routes for Vercel compatibility

### How to Test:
1. Visit: https://mirage-tenders-tracking-system.vercel.app/
2. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
3. Try adding a new tender
4. Check for error messages in console

### Expected Behavior:
- Tenders should save to browser localStorage
- API calls to `/api/sync` should work without errors
- Data should persist during the browser session

### Note:
Memory storage resets when Vercel functions "cold start" (restart), but localStorage in browser persists. For production use, this should be replaced with a proper database.

### If Still Not Working:
1. Clear browser storage: F12 â†’ Application â†’ Storage â†’ Clear storage
2. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check network tab for failed API calls
